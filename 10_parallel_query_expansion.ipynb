    "# Notebook 10 (Industrial Edition): Parallel Query Expansion for RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction: Overcoming the Vocabulary Mismatch Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook dives into our first advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern: **Parallel Query Expansion & Transformation**. This pre-retrieval strategy is designed to solve one of the most common failure modes in RAG systems: the **vocabulary mismatch problem**. Users often don't know the precise terminology used in the knowledge base, causing simple searches to miss relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Concept: Searching with Multiple Perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of taking the user's query at face value, we use a powerful LLM to brainstorm multiple, diverse ways to search for the same information. In a single, parallel-planned step, we can generate:\n",
    "1.  **Hypothetical Documents (HyDE):** A generated answer that is likely to be semantically similar to the true answer documents.\n",
    "2.  **Sub-Questions:** Decomposing a complex query into smaller, more specific questions.\n",
    "3.  **Keyword & Entity Extraction:** Identifying the core concepts for a precise search.\n",
    "\n",
    "By searching with all these perspectives at once, we dramatically increase the **recall** of our retrieval step—finding more of the relevant documents available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role in a Large-Scale System: Maximizing Knowledge Discovery & Improving Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "In any large-scale RAG system (e.g., an enterprise search engine, a research assistant), this pattern is critical for ensuring that the system is robust to user phrasing and can uncover all relevant information. Better recall at the retrieval stage directly leads to a more informed, comprehensive, and **accurate** final answer from the generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build and compare two RAG systems: a simple one using the raw query, and an advanced one using parallel query expansion. We will demonstrate that the advanced system produces a measurably more accurate and complete answer."
